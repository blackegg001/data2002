## 1 Predicting bodyfat (let's remove the numbers once we're done.)

::: notes
Notes: cardiovascular diseases, diabetes Mention examples of measurements we used Add pictures!
:::

-   Excess bodyfat creates health problems
-   Predictive model using other body measurements

## 2 Why?

-   Measurement usually requires:
    -   Specialised equipment
    -   High precision

## 3 Dataset

-   Source? (BYU but just be specific)

-   Units of measurement (I think it's imperial but we can discuss this)

-   Only includes adult males

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
bodyfat <- read_table("~/Downloads/bodyfat.txt")
```

## 4 Game Plan

:::{.notes}
mention that we derived BMI from the measurements
mention BMI is the rule of thumb
:::

-   Single linear regressions
    -   Model 1: Weight, Model 2: BMI
-   Multiple linear regression
    - Different methods of feature selection
-   Compare R-squared values at the end
